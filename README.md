Most of Colleges and Universities use the traditional lighting system where we have a switch to control the lighting. Most of us i.e students and faculty members are habituated towards leaving the class room without switching the lights, Fan, Air-conditioner etc which leads to unnecessary consumption of energy for organization and paying huge amount of bill from their budget. Some of the lighting systems have come with Remote system towards controlling the lighting and fan similar to air conditioner which is being used in homes. But still there is challenge towards leaving the lights and fans unattended when person not in the room. So accordingly, we here in this research have developed Automatic lighting and control using Microcontroller for the efficient use of energy in Class room condition where we have divided the class room into grids. The system developed will control lighting in particular area of classroom, based on the presence of human using passive infrared sensors placed in ceiling which would switch on or off based on presence of human in room irrespective of position. In addition, we also have provided the control of fan speed based on temperature using temperature sensor and relay .
